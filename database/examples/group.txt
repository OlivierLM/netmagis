#
# Example file for initial netmagis database creation:
#	Groups
#
# Use with netmagis-dbimport:
#	netmagis-dbimport group group.txt
#
# Format:
#	<group> <login> ... <login>
#
# Notes:
# - proper auth (internal or LDAP) must already be configured
# - groups may or may not already exist in database
# - users may or may not already exist in database
# - group wheel is created by default (netmagis-dbcreate) with
#	admin priviledges
# - users cited in the rootusers parameter of the netmagis.conf file
#	are automatically added to the group wheel when the database
#	is created
