Netmagis Application
--------------------

About
-----

Primary goal of the Netmagis application is to delegate DNS and
DHCP administration of some IPv4/v6 networks and domains to
users.

Netmagis is also the heart of a Network Information System. It
allows to:
- consult informations about a set of network equipments (map of
    equipments, of VLANS, of IP networks)
- modify configuration of equipments: delegate VLAN assignment
    to some users
- manage mail routing of a set of domains
- manage exceptions in mail routing
- manage exceptions in a SMTP authentified policy
