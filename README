Netmagis Application
--------------------

About
-----

Netmagis is a complete application, which allows a network administrator
to:
  - manage IPv4 and IPv6 addresses;
  - generate data for your DNS server and get BIND zone files always up
    to date and consistant;
  - delegate DNS management to other network administrators or every
    non-specialist of DNS management;
  - specify groups of users and very fine access privileges on
    address (even until every IPv4 or IPv6 address), on domains, etc;
  - manage DHCP allocations (both static or dynamic) with profiles to
    parametrize network boot;
  - use your existing LDAP directory to manage accounts, or manage
    accounts with the Netmagis database;
  - manage a large number of networks, users domains, DHCP profiles, etc.;
  - visualize with automatically generated network maps your network
    topology (switched or routed);
  - give access on these maps to users;
  - assign VLAN to equipment interfaces via a simple Web interface
    (for Cisco, HP or Juniper equipments);
  - delegate VLAN assignment to other network administrators or
    every non-specialist of equipment management;
  - access to traffic graphs that you have specified on your equipments.
  - locate hosts by IP address, MAC address or network equipement port

Netmagis uses a database describing your networks, privileges that
you give to groups of users, DHCP profiles that you want to assign
to DHCP ranges or hosts, etc. Netmagis is de facto a true network
information system.
