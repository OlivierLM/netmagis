Files in this directory provide some sample virtual equipments.


What are virtual equipments?
----------------------------

Virtual equipments are used by the topo module when an equipment
configuration cannot be parsed automatically by the topographd
daemon. This can occur for one of two reasons:
    - you don't have access to this equipment
    - or there is no Netmagis analyzer for this kind of equipment
You don't necessarily need to create virtual equipments. One reason
for doing so is that there is interesting equipment you want to see
on your network graphs (such as your operator router, for example).


How are used those files?
-------------------------

Each file provides a model of one equipment. Files must have the
".eq" suffix, and must reside in the directory referenced by the
"eqvirtdir" parameter in your netmagis.conf configuration file.

As soon they are in this directory, ".eq" files are detected and
analyzed by the "topographd" daemon if you have enabled it.


What is this example?
---------------------

This example is self contained. You can use it as a starting base
to explore virtual equipments and the topo module.

The network described in these files is:

    rtr (a router)
	ge-0/0/0 --------------> (another router, not described here)
		(Ethernet or WAN link)
	ge-0/0/1 -----L101-----> sw1
		(Ethernet 802.1Q with only one VLAN 123)
	ge-0/0/2 -----L102-----> sw2
		(Ethernet 802.1Q with two VLANs : 456 and 789)

	On this router:
	    Interconnection = 192.168.1.1/30 and 2001:660:0123:4000::1/64
	    VLAN 123 = 172.16.1.254/24 and 2001:660:0123:4001::1/64
	    VLAN 456 = 172.16.11.254/244 and 2001:660:0123:4011::11/64
	    VLAN 789 = 172.16.12.254/244

    sw1 (a simple switch)
	Gi0/0 --------------> a host
		(access port)
	Gi0/1 --------------> a host
		(access port)
	Gi0/23 -----L101-----> rtr
		(Ethernet 802.1Q with only one VLAN 123)

    sw2 (a more complex switch)
	Gi0/0 --------------> a host
		(Ethernet 802.1Q with two VLANs : 456 and 789)
	Gi0/1 --------------> a host
		(access port on VLAN 456)
	Gi0/2 --------------> a host
		(access port on VLAN 789)
	Gi0/23 -----L101-----> rtr
		(Ethernet 802.1Q with two VLANs : 456 and 789)



How virtual equipments are built?
---------------------------------

Each file is a model of an equipment, made by nodes and links
connecting nodes.

- physical ports are modelized by L1 nodes.
- each L1 node is connected to one or more VLANS, modelized by L2
    nodes. If you don't use IEEE 802.1Q VLANS, there must be a
    L2 node with VLAN 0
- a L2 node may be connected to some IP addresses (typically used
    in routers), modelized by L3 nodes. There may be more than one
    L3 node if you use IPv4 and IPv6, for example
- a L2 node may be connected to a bridge (typically used in switches)
- a L3 node may be connected to a routing instance

A switch typically has one or more "bridge" node (one for each
broadcast domain). Each physical interface (L1 node) is connected
to one or more L2 nodes (each L2 node is included in one broadcast
domain). All L2 nodes participating to one broadcast domain are
connected through the same bridge node.

A router has one or more routing instances, represented as "router"
nodes. You can have more than one routing instance if your router
is dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6), and/or if you have virtual router
instances. Each routing instance is connected to L3 nodes (one for
each IP address), which in turn are connected to L2 nodes, which in
turn are connected to physical interfaces (L1 nodes).

A switch-router is nothing more than an equipment with router and
bridge nodes.
