Rancid patch to collect server network configuration

* How it works

  This is completely based on the idea and the code of Michael Stefaniuc : 

  http://www.shrubbery.net/pipermail/rancid-discuss/2005-November/001276.html

  This patch creates a new type of network equipement called "server"
  in Rancid. To use it, you need to declare your server in rancid
  as any other equipements, and choose "server" as equipement type.

  Rancid calls wrancid (a wrapper) to fetch the configuration on
  the server. The wrapper starts another program (serverscript)
  which :
  - connects via ssh to the server
  - starts a script on the server (called "parsenet")
  Parsenet outputs the network configuration in an IOS-like format
  Rancid records the output and versions it, as it woukd do with
  any other equipement.

  NB : you need to setup a trust relationship between the rancid
  host and the server.  We advise you to user a user with the least
  priviledges on the server (ie. not root) and to only grant him
  the rights to execute "parsenet" (via sudo for example).

* Installation

  * patch the rancid front-end script (rancid-fe) in the
  rancid binary directory on your system : /usr/lib/rancid/bin
  on Debian/Ubuntu, /usr/local/libexec/rancid on FreeBSD
  (the patch is against Rancid 2.3.6) :

	cd "your rancid binary directory"
  	patch -p1 < ~/netmagis/topo/rancid/rancid-server.patch

  * copy the generic wrapper and the script called by the wrapper
  in the same directory :

  	cp topo/rancid/wrancid topo/rancid/serverscript \
		"you rancid binary directory"
	
  * On each server you want to poll with rancid, install the
    "parsenet" script in /usr/local/bin
