    \titre {1} {Netmagis: Screenshots}

    You will find some \lien {Netmagis} {/intro.html} (release 2.1.0)
    screenshots.

    Moreover, you can experiment this application thanks to a on-line
    demo (not available at this time).
    \* \lien {demonstration version} {/demo.html}.


    \titre {2} {Main menu}

	This screenshot shows the main menu and the various
	functionnalities for every Netmagis user.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-index.png} {Main menu}} {shot-index.png}}

    \titre {2} {Information consultation}

	The first screenshot shows informations stored for the user
	(such as she report any modifications), coming from your
	LDAP directory or from the integrated authentication database.
	It next shows available networks (IPv4 as well as IPv6, with
	organization). Starting from here, it is possible to select
	one or more networks or to type directly the network address.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-consult1.png} {Network selection}} {shot-consult1.png}}

	Once the network is selected, Netmagis displays informations
	about registered hosts (main name, aliases in italics, IPv4 and
	IPv6 addresses, etc.).

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-consult2.png} {Display hosts in network}} {shot-consult2.png}}

	You may notice that demonstration database is derived from the
	initial loading of the database, from existing BIND zone files,
	some informations are not stored (MAC address, OS, comments,
	etc.).

	Netmagis can display an "address map" graphically showing
	IP address allocation.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-map.png} {Display of hosts in network}} {shot-map.png}}

	Starting from this map, it is possible to add a new host, or
	to modify or delete an existing host.

    \titre {2} {Host addition}

	This screenshot shows addition of a host, the search for a
	contiguous block of free addresses, and addition fo an alias (you
	can do only one of these actions at a time). This example shows
	the menu of available domains for a user. Here, the user has
	typed all informations (including the MAC address since she
	wish to use the DHCP functionnality of Netmagis), even if most
	of them are optional.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-add.png} {Host addition}} {shot-add.png}}

	You may notice that OS types are defined by the Netmagis
	administrator, as well as domains and access rights to these
	domains.

	Since the user has checked the "Emit with SMTP" box, the host
	will be authorized to emit mails with non authenticated SMTP
	when the user will approve some context elements presented on
	the next screenshot. Activation of this functionnality is
	of course configurable by the administrator and needs IP
	filtering support on your mail relays, as explained in the
	documentation.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-smtp.png} {Host addition}} {shot-smtp.png}}

	It is also possible to add more addresses to an existing host.
	It is the case for example when you want to add an IPv6 address
	to a host having already an IPv4 address. Netmagis detect
	addition of multiple addresses and ask for confirmation.

	Research for a contiguous block of free addresses give the next
	page, which shows all available blocks. In the demonstration
	database, as seen above in the "map", there is only one large
	free block after some declared hosts. Even if they are not shown
	in the demonstration database, dynamic DHCP ranges are correctly
	managed.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-seq.png} {Host addition}} {shot-seq.png}}

	When the user has choosen a block, she may start to enter
	informations about the hosts she want to add.

    \titre {2} {Host deletion}

	The next screenshot shows deletion of a host (or an alias) by
	name or by IP address.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-del.png} {Host deletion}} {shot-del.png}}

    \titre {2} {Host modification}

	It is possible to modify host attributes. The first step is to
	select the host, has shown in the next screenshot:

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-mod1.png} {Selection of the host to modify}} {shot-mod1.png}}

	Next, the page shows all host attributes to modify.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-mod2.png} {Host attributes edition}} {shot-mod2.png}}

    \titre {2} {DHCP parameters modification}

	Netmagis stores MAC addresses to perform DHCP static allocation
	(i.e. IPv4 address is associated to a MAC address). It is also
	possible to define address ranges for dynamic allocation. The
	next screenshot shows the network selection page in order to
	edit DHCP ranges.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-dhcp1.png} {Network selection for DHCP range modification}} {shot-dhcp1.png}}

	The next screenshot shows one range defined for this network. Is
	is possible to modify this range, to delete it, or to add new
	ones with the same menu.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-dhcp2.png} {DHCP range edition}} {shot-dhcp2.png}}

    \titre {2} {Topology module}

	The topology module fetches configurations from network
	equipments and analyzes them. It is then possible to have
	a view of all equipments.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-topo.png} {Topo module welcome page}} {shot-topo.png}}

	Selecting an equipment gives a detailed view:

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-eq.png} {Equipment list}} {shot-eq.png}}

	Allowed users (access is granted by rights on VLANs and
	equipments) may follow the "Edit" link to change VLAN
	assignment to individual ports.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-ifchg.png} {Interface modification}} {shot-ifchg.png}}

	An added value of Netmagis is the network map: it is possible
	to ask for the map of parts of your network (access is
	granted by rights on VLANs and equipments).  Here is a L2
	map (Netmagis provides also L3 maps).

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-l2.png} {L2 network map}} {shot-l2.png}}

	In the detailed view of equipments, following the "Traffic"
	link brings you to the RRD-based traffic graphs.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-metro.png} {Traffic graph}} {shot-metro.png}}


    \titre {2} {Administrator menu}

	The next screenshot shows the menu allowed only for
	the Netmagis administrator.

	\retrait {\lien {\image {vign-admin.png} {Netmagis administration menu}} {shot-admin.png}}

	You can discover by yourself and experiment all administration
	possibilities with the on-line \lien {demonstration version}
	{/demo.html}.
