    Release date: not yet.

    \liste {
	\item {The DNS zone generation latency has been improved.
	    A new auto-adaptative algorithm has been implemented
	    in order to allow more than 100 modifications of a
	    zone in a day. The \teletype {mkzone} script may now
	    run each minute.
	}
	\item {The "consult" page in the Web application may now
	    export a list of hosts in CSV (Comma Separated Values)
	    format.
	}
	\item {Reverse zones are listed in correct order (by IP
	    address) in the "modify reverse IPv[46] zones" menu.
	}
	\item {Bug fix: when using multiple interface edition,
	    the description and sensors are no longer reset.
	}
	\item {Bug fix: some SQL constraints (on DNS zones)
	    were not checked, which may have caused some
	    (very obvious) inconsistencies in zone generation.
	}
    }

    \titre {2} {\ancre {v2.1} {Netmagis 2.1}}

    Release date: 22 june 2012.

    This release is the first since the initial Netmagis release in
    november 2011. It brings integration of two major tools (Metro and
    Mac packages) and focuses on ease of installation, even if it
    provides some other new and nice features.

    \liste {
	\item {The Metro package is now integrated. If equipments
	    are configured with proper \italique {sensor names},
	    the metrology package periodically polls them for traffic
	    information, and traffic graphs are available in the
	    Netmagis Web interface.

	}
	\item {The MAC package is now integrated. It register in the
	    Netmagis database (or another database if you fear performance
	    problems) MAC-Ports associations as well as MAC-IP associations.
	    These informations are available in the Netmagis Web interface.

	}
	\item {Linux Debian/Ubuntu packages are now provided (as well
	    as FreeBSD ports) for ease of installation. Appropriate
	    documentation is provided as well.

	}
	\item {Greatly improve \lien {installation documentation}
	    {install-2.1.html}.

	}
	\item {PostgreSQL users are now simplified: you need to create
	    only one user, which will be used everywhere.

	}
	\item {Symbols used in L2 and L3 graphs (topology package) may now
	    be modified by the administrator through the Netmagis Web
	    admin interface.

	}
	\item {Some parameters such as paper format and pdflatex program
	    path are now configurable through the Netmagis Web admin
	    interface.

	}
	\item {The Rancid configuration has been simplified: the
	    \teletype {ranciddb} and \teletype {rancidconfdir}
	    parameters are removed and the new \teletype {ranciddir}
	    replaces them in \teletype {netmagis.conf} file.

	}
	\item {Configuration commands (used to determine which commands
	    are to be sent to an equipment in order to modify port
	    configuration) are now editable through the Web application
	    and are no longer hard-coded in the \teletype {toposend} program.

	}
	\item {The generated network graph built by the topology
	    package is now copied from the topo server (by the \teletype
	    {topographd} program) to the www server (if they are distinct
	    servers). This brings more performance to the Web application.

	}
	\item {Graphviz dot and neato commands are the same command. The
	    \teletype {netmagis.conf} file is simplified accordingly.

	}

    }
